Alone or in groups of two, evaluate one or more of the example repositories using the questions listed below. You will have 15 minutes to complete this activity. We will debrief as a group afterward, but please donâ€™t hesitate to ask questions as you go along.

#### Example repositories
* [github.com/jquery/jquery](http://github.com/jquery/jquery)
* [github.com/kennethreitz/requests](http://github.com/kennethreitz/requests)
* [github.com/activeadmin/activeadmin](http://github.com/activeadmin/activeadmin)


#### Project Health
How popular is the repository? How many stars? How many watchers?




When was the last commit made? Is there a lot of commit activity? Are the commit messages meaningful?




How many contributors are there?




Is there help provided for people who submit pull requests?




#### Project Support
How many open issues are there? How useful do the discussions seem? Are issues resolved quickly? Are the issues labeled? Is there evidence of discussion or interest from the developers?




How many forks are there? Do the forks point to abandoned software? Do the forks result in pull requests?



Does the project have a release? When was the last one created? How do they manage versions?




Is it a good first project for submitting a pull request? Would you feel comfortable submitting a pull request to this project? Why?




#### Project Documentation
Does the project make a strong case for why it is useful or necessary? Why is it a better option than others?




Does the project have or link to any documentation? How easy does it look to get started? How helpful is the getting started guide?




Does the project link to any community resources?



Is there a demo (if appropriate) or link to a production version? Is there a list of people who use the project?




Does the project have a license?
