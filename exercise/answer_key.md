* Requests
  * Seems like a good project for a first pull request, though it might be hard to do given the maturity of the proejct.
* Active Admin
  * Probably not, given the reluctance to release appropriate versions of software. This means that it would be hard to utilize your contributions in your application.

#### Project Documentation
Does the project make a strong case for why it is useful or necessary? Why is it a better option than others?
* jQuery
  * Not documented in the repo, but jQuery has a huge reputation and probably doesn't need to make a case.
* Requests
  * Yes, the README succinctly argues for the value of the library. Shows what code would be required if you weren't using the library.
* Active Admin
  * Live demo goes a long way to making a case for the project, though it could be stronger. Not much to recommend it over competitors.
